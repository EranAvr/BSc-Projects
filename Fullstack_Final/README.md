This is a project I built in my Full-Stack course.
In this project, I made a simple web interface for
admins and regular users, with login/register options and
customized interfaces panel.

For frontend app, I used React.js .

As for the backend app, I used Node.JS and Express framework
to build the server and MongoDB for my database.
